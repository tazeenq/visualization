# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like!

Bad Visualization: Manning, L. (2011, April 26). Tree Map on Food Consumption. Available at https://www.flickr.com/photos/laurenmanning/5658976485/

Good Visualization: Arnita, D. (2024, November 27). European Nations: GDP, Digital Economy and DESI Index. Available at https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/devi.arnita/viz/FlowerFiedlDigitalTerbaruFINALTWBXPublic/RosesFlowerField

- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      Good Visualization: European Nations: GDP, Digital Economy, and DESI Index (this is an interactive Tableau visualization)
      This visualization effectively communicates key data points with clarity and is visually appealing. I classified it as good because:
      1. The visualization's use of roses of various sizes to depict GDP, DESI Index score, and market values is in line with Gestalt principles like size comparison and grouping - making it easier to infer relationships intuitively.
      2. The visualization connect growth in DESI scores with economic indicators, balancing substantive and perceptual qualities. This ensures accurate representation of data while also engaging the viewer.
      3. The color scheme is accessible - i.e. distinguishable - and uses high contrast, which can be helpful to viewers with visual impairments. This is in line with best practices for accessibility.
      4. The labels like "How to Read it" explain the logic behind the visualization. The inclusion of axes and legends improves interpretability.

      Bad Visualization: Tree Map on Food Consumption (this visualization is not interactive)
      This visualization is not able to effectively communicate data because of the following reasons:
      1. The visualization uses an uncoordinated color scheme, violating basic principles of visual perception and accessibility. It causes confusion, specially for viewers with visual impairments like colorblindness.
      2. Categories like "chicken" and "veggies" occupy disproportionate space in the map, while smaller categories are visually marginalized. This is creating a bias in representation that can cause misinterpretation.
      3. There is a clear lack of scale or axis, leaving viewers without any context to compare to. This fails a substantive criteria required to interpret data.
      4. Data labels are inconsistent (font sizes, abbreviations, placement, etc.), which makes the viewer guess relationships between categories, which can increase cognitive load.
      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      To improve on the bad visualization, I would:
      - Use a consisten color scheme - a cohesive color palette with appropriate levels of contrast.
      - Include a legend and annotations that clearly label categories and provide additonal context on how to read this visualization.
      - Replace the treemap with a bar chart or stacked bar plot to compare quantities directly. Sometimes creativity is counterproductive to communicating data effectively.
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)

### Why am I doing this assignment?:

- This assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
