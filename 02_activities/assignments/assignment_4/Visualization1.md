## Visualization 1 using Python (Pandas and Matplotlib)

I have created two visualizations using the Retail Sales dataset. **The code and visualizations are in the file titled: 'Visualization1.ipynb'**

**What software did you use to create your data visualization?**
I used Python with Pandas for data handling and Matplotlib for creating the visualizations.

**Who is your intended audience?**
My audience includes educators, policymakers, and common readers who are interested in analyzing retail sales data trends. They may not all have technical expertise, so the visualizations are designed to be accessible and clear to a broad audience​.

**What information or message are you trying to convey with your visualization?**
The goal is to highlight trends, outliers, and relationships in the retail sales dataset, such as sales performance over time, category contributions, and regional patterns. Each visualization is tailored to answer a specific question about the dataset​.

**What design principles (substantive, perceptual, aesthetic) did you consider when making your visualization? How did you apply these principles? With what elements of your plots?**
1. Substantive: My visualizations represent the data accurately without misleading the audience. I tried to main the integrity of data while preprocessing it.
2. Perceptual: I've added clear labels, consistent scales, and appropriate chart types (e.g., line charts for trends, bar charts for comparisons) to communicate data. 
3. Aesthetic: I chose colors from accessible palettes (Viridis) to accommodate viewers with color vision deficiencies​. I also chose fonts and sizes to ensure readability.

**How did you ensure that your data visualizations are reproducible? If the tool you used to make your data visualization is not reproducible, how will this impact your data visualization?**
The code for the visualizations is written in Python and stored in a jupyter notebook with detailed comments, ensuring all steps from data preprocessing to plotting can be replicated. This approach aligns with best practices for reproducibility​. As opposed to my other visualization in Excel, I did not do any manual editing which could have been untraceable.

**How did you ensure that your data visualization is accessible?**
- I used accessible color palettes (Viridis) to account for color blindness.
- I included labels and legends with sufficient contrast and descriptive text.
- I made sure that font sizes and plot elements were large enough for readability​.

**Who are the individuals and communities who might be impacted by your visualization?**
Retail managers, marketing professionals, and supply chain analysts might use these visualizations to make data-driven decisions, which could influence sales strategies and customer experiences. Additionally, the visualization's accessible design can promote inclusivity for individuals with disabilities​.

**How did you choose which features of your chosen dataset to include or exclude from your visualization?**
I selected the features based on their relevance to the analysis questions and the visualization’s purpose. For example, columns irrelevant to identifying sales trends (e.g., Transaction and Customer IDs) were excluded to avoid clutter.

**What ‘underwater labour’ contributed to your final data visualization product?**
- Data cleaning, including handling missing values and ensuring consistency in data formats.
- Preprocessing to transform and aggregate data for specific analyses.
- Iterative design adjustments to refine clarity, readability, and accuracy​.
