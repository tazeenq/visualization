# Data Visualization

## Assignment 3: Data Visualization Ethics

### Requirements:
- Let‚Äôs return to the data visualizations we evaluated for Assignment 2.
Bad Visualization: Manning, L. (2011, April 26). Tree Map on Food Consumption. Available at https://www.flickr.com/photos/laurenmanning/5658976485/

Good Visualization: Arnita, D. (2024, November 27). European Nations: GDP, Digital Economy and DESI Index. Available at https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/devi.arnita/viz/FlowerFiedlDigitalTerbaruFINALTWBXPublic/RosesFlowerField

- For each visualization: 
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) whether or not you think this data visualization is accessible, reproducible, and equitable. 
        ```
        Good Visualization: European Nations: GDP, Digital Economy and DESI Index (interactive Tableau viz.)
        - The visualization is quite accessible. It uses different colors and high contrast, which make it easier for most viewers to interpret. Labels like ‚ÄúHow to Read It‚Äù enhance clarity for audiences with varying expertise. However, the use of roses for data representation might confuse viewers with cognitive impairments or sensory issues. Adding numerical labels or patterns would improve clarity.
        - This visualization is not fully reproducible. While sources are cited, details on how the visualization was created (e.g., tools, code, or dataset access) are not available. Without clear documentation, recreating it is challenging. Sharing the methodology, such as through an open-source platform can address this gap.
        - The visualization shows data for various countries, offering regional balance. However, smaller economies are visually overshadowed due to the rose size hierarchy, which overemphasizes wealthier nations. Accessibility for audiences using assistive technologies is not explicitly addressed, limiting its equity.

        
        Bad Visualization: Tree Map on Food Consumption (not interactive)
        - The visualization is not accessible. It uses an inconsistent and overwhelming color palette, making it particularly difficult for colorblind users. Labels are inconsistent, and smaller sections are nearly illegible, increasing cognitive load for viewers.
        - The visualization lacks reproducibility. There is no documentation about data sources or the software/tools used, which prevents others from verifying or recreating it.
        - The treemap design prioritizes larger categories like "chicken," visually diminishing smaller ones such as "salad". This biased representation skews the audience‚Äôs perception of data proportions. Additionally, it does not consider assistive technologies‚Äã. 
        ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved (in terms of accessibility, reproducibility, equity)?  
        ```
        The bad visualization can be improved by:
        - Using an accessible color palette like Viridis, ensuring contrast for colorblind viewers‚Äã
        - Adding clear labels and numerical values for each section to reduce cognitive load‚Äã
        - Documenting data sources and tools, and share the methodology to enable reproducibility‚Äã
        - Employing alternative chart types like stacked bar graphs to distribute focus more equitably across categories
        ```

- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 300 words for each visualization. 

### Why am I doing this assignment?:
- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses learning outcomes 2 and 3:  
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story

### Rubric:
